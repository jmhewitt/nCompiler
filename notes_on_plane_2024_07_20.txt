Notes for nCompiler

- Need a new CppAD installation
- Last I checked, Eigen in RcppEigen was far out of date.
- Not sure about cereal up-to-dateness.

- Want to work with packaging example from the start.
- packageWithDefn and save_nClass roxygen clunky. Can an nClass detect if it is in a package?

- utils::getFromNamespace
- review loadedObjectEnv scheme

- allow saving and loading without package def at all (which will only work within the same R session, e.g. for testing purposes.)

- read_nClass should be load_nClass
- Duncan????

- I can't see how Eigen objects are supported for cereal

- Review outline of C++ naming system in comments of nCompile

serialization status guesses:
- outline of handling C++ objects in place, but diverted by a "hello world".
- connecting the R side and the C++ side might not be done yet.

loadedObjectEnv:
- make_DLLenv() gives an env with class "nComp_DLL_env" and parent nCompiler namespace.
- setup_CnC_environments(...) sets up compiled nClass environments
- setup_CnC_env sets up an env with class "CnClass_env" and parent the DLLenv. It has a fxn set_CnClass_env_<nClass name> that is called once so that the CnClass_env env can be held in C++.

- a loadedObjectEnv holds an extptr and has as its parent env the CnClass_env. This allows finding the .R6interface if built and serialization.
- the extptr points to a shared_ptr_holder< nClass_type >

- Review thinking on nClass R/C++ issues.
- i.e. R object holding another R object vs C++ object vs C++ object holding another object, and with either generic or full interface.
- loadedObjectHookC uses some statics. Will it be an issue for parallelization?

- Work with R parallelization example from the start.
- Need generic deep copy feature? Is serialization a good way to do this???

- rename to_full_interface to as_full_interface

- Review serialObjectEnv


- Figure out proper null/void ptr system in C++.

- unique_ptr vs shared_ptr and cereal needs
