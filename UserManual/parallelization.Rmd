The current plan is to adopt Threading Building Blocks (TBB), a library from Intel.  This is the same library adopted by `RcppParallel`.  As with the Eigen, CppAD, and cereal packages, `nCompiler` will code-generate C++ that uses TBB.

TBB manages thread creation, saving the programmer a lot of hassle.

Everything in TBB is class (functor) based.  The goal is to generate `nClass` classes in this role.

This will require some additional control from R of fine-scale C++, such as class constructors with member data initializers.
