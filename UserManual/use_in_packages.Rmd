# Using nCompiler code in packages

It will be useful to include R and generated C++ from nCompiler in new packages.

Following is an example of how to do so for an `nClass`.

```{r}
library(nCompiler)
nc1 <- nClass(
  classname = "nc1",
  Cpublic = list(
    x = 'numericScalar',
    cp1 = nFunction(
      fun = function(x = double()) {
        ans <- x+1
        return(ans)
        returnType(double())
      }
    )
  )
)
writePackage(nc1, package.name = "nc1Package", clean = TRUE)
buildPackage("nc1Package")
obj <- nc1Package::new_nc1()
method(obj, 'cp1')(2) # It works.
```

# Future plans

- Also embed "full" `nClass` interface R code in packages.
- Improve naming.
- Support multiple objects, exporting, and other basic package choices.
