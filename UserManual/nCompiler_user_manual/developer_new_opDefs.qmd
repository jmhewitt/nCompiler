title: "Providing operator definitions for new keywords or nClass methods"
---

`nCompiler` is designed to be extensible.

## Defining how new keywords should be handled

If you want to support a new keyword for compilation, you can do so by providing an operator definition, including handlers for any compilation stage(s) where they are needed. This is done by `registerOpDef` and can be removed by `deregisterOpDef`.

A difference from built-in handlers is that a new handler can be provided as a function rather than just the name of a function.

## Defining how `nClass` methods should be handled.

**This is an idea not yet implemented**.

It would be nice to allow controllable and extensible handling of any method (`nFunction`) within an `nClass`.
