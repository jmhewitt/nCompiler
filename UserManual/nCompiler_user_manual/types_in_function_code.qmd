## Quick summary

-   Usually variables inside `nFunction` code will have their types deduced automatically and match R's behavior.

-   If you need to take more control, you can do so.

Types of variables created in a function will be automatically determined from the code. For example:

## The type of a variable can't be changed

Once a variable is created, its type can't later be changed.

## The mimic-R rule

To the extent possible, nCompiler mimics R's output types based on input types. There are cases where this is impossible.

## Surprises and manual control over types

Sometimes you may be surprised by the deduced type of a variable.

-   declare()

-   checking types

-   create a variable with an explicit type

-   Dimensions

-   `nCpp`

### Automatic conversions among types when possible

Tip: Sometimes types will differ from R

## To-do:

-   Add type inspection features for debugging.
