title: "Passing arguments by copy, reference or block reference"
---

## Quick summary

-   By default, arguments are passed by copy (like R), so that changes to values are only local.

-   You can pass arguments by reference (very unlike R), so that changes to values are also seen from the calling function.

-   Passing by "block reference" allows changes to values by reference but doesn't allow changing the size. This is useful if, for example, you want to pass `x[11:20, 11:20]` as a matrix by reference.
